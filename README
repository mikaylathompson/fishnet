fishnet
======================

fishnet is a simple link-gathering and sharing app. 
Essentially, it's your bookmarks, but with annotations and the ability to share
a link to particular folders or your entire profile.
Your fishnet is where you can keep track of resources and readings, but
it can also showcase what you're thinking about or working on at the moment.

Most of all, it's an exercise to learn/practice Flask, Python, and vim.



And we're live!!  Fishnet can be accessed at http://www.fishnet.in
