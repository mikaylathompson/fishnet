fishnet
======================

fishnet is a simple link-gathering app. 
Essentially, it's your bookmarks, but with annotations and the ability to share.
Your fishnet is where you can keep track of resources and readings, but
it can also showcase what you're thinking about or working on at the moment.
At the moment, admin is the only login, and there's only a main folder.

To-do list:
Allow registration
Define per-user URLs to enable sharing
Add tags
